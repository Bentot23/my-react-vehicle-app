Once you opened up your code editor, run ```npm install && npm start``` to install the dependencies and get the app running.

## How it works:

* When you type and search in the search field, type in the first letter of any vehicle model you can think of and it will show all vehicles that has that letter.
* You can click the image of any vehicle to see the interior and click it again to show the previous image/exterior.
* When the info icon is clicked, it will show information about the vehicle. Just click on the description to collapse it. 
* You can also add a vehicle of your choice that is not on the list by clicking the Add Vehicle button on the navbar. A form will pop up. Just fill in the required inputs and submit, and this will be addded to the vehicle list.
* Another way to search is using the search field dropdown button, which also shows you vehicle options.
